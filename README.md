## 📖 Course Description
Definite and indefinite integrals of single-variable functions. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Techniques of integration. Hyperbolic functions. Applications of the definite integral to area, volume, arc length, and surface area. Improper integrals. Sequences and series: convergence tests (integral, comparison, ratio, root), alternating series, absolute/conditional convergence, power series, and Taylor/Maclaurin series.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Estimate areas and definite integrals by Riemann sums and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
2. Evaluate integrals using standard techniques and compute averages, areas, volumes, lengths, and surface areas.
3. Evaluate improper integrals and limits of sequences.
4. Apply convergence tests for series and evaluate selected convergent series.
5. Determine interval/radius of convergence and express functions as power series (Taylor/Maclaurin).
